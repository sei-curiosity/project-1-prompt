## Planning and Development Process

A basic story of your planning and developing this project.

I started the project with the layout first. I then specified the entities (the basic ones) that would set the skeleton of the program. Then, I styled the entities. Finally, I added some features that would make the game more appealing.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

What strategy did you use to solve your problems.

Asking and constant modification to the code.

### Unsolved problems

List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.

I guess I would like to integrate AI into future games.
